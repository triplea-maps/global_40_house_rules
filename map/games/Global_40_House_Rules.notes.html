<b>Global 1940 Second Edition</b><br>
<br>
<b>Original Game Credits:</b> Bung, Veqryn<br><br>
<br>
<b>Global 40 House Rules</b><br>
<br>
Global 40 House Rules is an ongoing project that adds "House Rules" using Technologies. Simply add the rules you want by using edit mode. <br>
<br>You may also activate certain "House Rules" prior to game start in "Map Options".<br>
<br>
Game starts with 2nd edition OOB rules, techs and units, with the exception of Sierra Leone and Yukon Territory (you can Edit to OOB) which are British controlled. Also the OOB National Objective of +5 PUs for Russian control of Germany has been removed.<br>
<br>
A player named "Changer" will go first. His purpose is to activate certain technologies so the game may begin with them. There are 17 of these techs.<br>
Each one has "ChangerMustActivate" at the end of them.<br>
<br>
Changer has only 1 turn, so if techs are not activated then, you will be unable to activate them later.<br>
<br>
<b>Note</b> You can Edit some Changer Techs after Changer's turn but they may not activate correctly.<br>
<br>
Excluding the OOB techs, Germany activates the remaining techs for all players, except for those that end in "GiveToAll". 
"GiveToAll" techs must be given to each player in order for them to have the tech ability.<br>
<br>
Germany needs to activate techs at the start of their turn in order for them to activate that turn. Activated after their turn starts and techs won't activate until their next turn.<br>
<br>
<b>Note</b><br>UK Pacific techs are automatically activated by the British.<br>
<br>
<b>Note</b><br>Convoy Zone Losses are not shown at the end of turn the way Blockade is.<br>
They are <b>Not</b> shown in "Game History"<br>
<br>
<b>Note</b><br>When using Edit some Units have the same Image.<br><br>
<b>Here is the Tech Tree for "Global 40 House Rules"</b> minus the OOB techs:<br>
<br>
<b>"Changer"</b><br>
<b>1) "BM_Rules__ChangerMustActivate"</b><br>
Activates all of the BM Rules except for Interceptors/Escorts Air Battle at 2, which are activated by Country. Some BM Rules may also be activated individually.<br>
<br>
<b>Note</b><br>The "Vichy Rule" and "Chinese Guerrillas" must be Activated separately when using "Map Options".<br>
Escorts_Interceptors_A2D2_GiveToAll is activated with this "Option".<br>
<br>
<b>2) "Attack0Cost5Bomber_ChangerMustActivate"</b><br>
Bombers are now a A0 D0 M6 +1 w/AB C5 unit. They may perform SBR attacks only. They do not participate in the Air Battle with Interceptors. They do 1-6 damage. They no longer receive a +2 to an SBR attack.<br>
<br>
Due to the Japanese Bombers not being able to participate in regular combat, an Airfield is placed in Formosa, which allows the Formosa Fighter to be able to strike Yunnan Round 1. <br>
<br>
It also moves the 19 Sea Zone Sub and Destroyer to 20 Sea Zone. This allows the option of striking the British Battleship in 37 Sea Zone on a Round 1 Japanese Attack.<br>
<br>
Germany has a Destroyer placed in 113 Sea Zone and United Kingdom has a Destroyer placed in 81 Sea Zone. This compensates for the lack of Strategic Bombers in Round 1 Attacks. Also adds German Tactical Bomber to Romania and British Tactical Bomber to Newfoundland Labrador.<br>
<br>
Italy has a Tactical bomber placed in Sicily.<br>
<br>
<b>Note</b><br>
Even though they are A0 D0 for normal combat, they still produce a hitpoint. This is unintended and will be fixed in the future.<br>
So don't take them as casualties in normal combat until all other units have been destroyed or finish battle and use edit to kill them.<br>
While a bit of a hassle, it's not unplayable as these situations are somewhat rare.
<br><br>
May also be activated via <b>Map Options</b>.<br>
<br>
<b> 3) "SubsCanEvadeDestroyers_ChangerMustActivate"</b><br>
Destroyers no longer block Subs or the Sub's "First Strike" capability. They are now a A1 D1 M2 +1 w/NB C5 unit. They also have 1 preemptive "ASA" (Anti-Sub Attack) shot.<br>
<br>
<b>Note</b><br>
If necessary activate "BB and CA 2 Shot" to prevent DDC5 spammage or use "Destroyer Cost 6".<br><br>
When attacking a Sub, the Destroyer will fire a one time "ASA1" (hits at 2 out of 12) shot. If successful, the Sub is immediately destroyed and may not return fire. If the Sub survives, it may then submerge or take its normal "First Strike" shot.<br>
<br>
The Destroyer also has 1 preemptive "ASD" (Anti-Sub Defense) shot for combat and 1 for movement. It hits at 1 out of 12. So when a Sub attacks a Destroyer, it will undergo 1 ASD shot when the Sub enters the Destroyer's Sea Zone and 1 ASD shot at the beginning of Combat. Both of these attacks occur before the Subs First Strike.<br>
<br>
Destroyers will fire 1 ASD shot when Subs pass through the Destroyer's Sea Zone whether during Combat Move or Non Combat Move.<br>
<br>
<b>Note</b><br> When moving through or into Sea Zones containing a Destroyer, you should form your Subs into "Wolfpacks" and move them together where possible. The Destroyer only has 1 movement ASD shot and will only fire once. If you move into or through the Sea Zone separately, the Destroyer will fire each time a Sub enters it's Sea Zone.<br>
Destroyer ASA/D shots will stack. Meaning if there is only 1 Sub and multiple Destroyers, the sub will undergo as many ASA/D shots as there are Destroyers.<br>
<br>
Subs remain A2 D1 M2 +1 w/NB C6. Subs cannot be blocked by any Naval Vessel. Subs are now susceptible to counterattack from Fighters and Tac Bombers. When attacking naval units who have air units present, Subs will undergo counterfire from the air units regardless of the outcome of their "First Strike".<br>
When defending against attack by air units the sub may still submerge before the attack (except for the Tac Bombers ASA shot mentioned below).<br><br>
Subs in Blockade Zones may either retreat or undergo 1 Round of Combat from ASW Units during the Subs Combat phase.<br><br>
All other rules regarding Subs are unchanged.<br>
<br>
<b>Note</b><br> When moving a sub through a contested Sea Zone, you must move in one continuous movement. If you stop in the contested Sea Zone you will be unable to pass through.<br>
<br>You will also be unable to undo your move once being "Depth Charged". Includes if you stop after the "Depth Charging" and still have movement left.<br>
<br>
In addition to it's normal unit stats, Tac Bombers now have 1 ASA1 and ASD1 each. Their ASA shot will hit at 2 out of 12. Their ASD shot will hit at 1 out of 12. They will stack. Meaning if there is only 1 Sub and multiple Tacs, the sub will undergo as many ASA/ASD shots as there are Tacs. They only fire during the Combat Phase.<br>
<br>
As mentioned above, it now fires normally at subs without a Destroyer present.<br>
<br>
<b>Note</b><br>
If "PlanesTargetNaval" and or "PlanesTargetNavalCV" has been activated then Tactical Bombers ASA and ASD shots will no longer <b>Stack</b>. Meaning only 1 shot per sub no matter how many Tacs are present.<br><br>
<br>

<br>
If "SubsCanEvadeDestroyers_ChangerMustActivate" has been activated, it becomes a A1 D1 M2 +1 w/NB C9 with 1, ASA1 and ASD1, each. They hit at 1 out of 6. It's ASA/D shots stack same as Destroyers. It can carry 1 Fighter or Tactical Bomber.<br>
<br>
May also be activated via <b>Map Options</b>.<br>
<br>
<b>Note</b><br>Shipyard tech currently does not work when Escort Carriers are activated. This will be fixed in the future.<br>
<br>
<b>8) "FlyingTiger_ChangerMustActivate"</b><br>
Changes the US Fighter at the Philippines into a "FlyingTiger" unit. This unit may move to Dutch or UK Pacific territories during it's ncm while US is neutral.

<b>9) "FactoryLimited_ChangerMustActivate"</b><br>
Air and Naval Bases now cost 12. All captured and newly constructed Minor Factories may only produce Artillery, AAguns, Armor, Mech Infantry, Mobile Infantry, Marines, Elite and Infantry. If a NB is present you may also build Subs, Transports, Escort Carriers and Destroyers. If an AB is present you may also build Fighters and Tac Bombers.<br>
<br>
ABs are required to build Fighters, Tac Bombers, Bombers and Air Transports. Bombers and Air Transports may only be built in Factories on originally owned Territories that also have an AB. In addition, Bombers and Air Transports may not be built in the following territories: Kwangtung, Egypt, Norway, Alaska, West India and Korea. May not build at an AB with 3 or more damage.<br>
<br>
<b>Note:</b> You may not place new Fighters on CVs. All air units may only be placed in the Territory that contains an AB as well as the correct Factory.<br>
<br>
NBs are required to build all Naval Units. BBs, CVs and CAs may only be built in Territories with originally owned starting Factories. These Territories must also have a NB (Need not be original NB). May not build at a NB with 3 or more damage.<br>
<br>
New Zealand receives a Minor Factory to allow ANZAC Air builds. Quebec receives a NB to allow for Naval builds. The Central United States receives a NB to allow for additional prewar Naval builds.<br>
<br>
This addresses Capital Ships and Bombers being built in newly conquered Territories. It should also be noted that UK may only build Air Units in UK at game start. This makes the UK AB a prime Axis target.<br>

<br>
Strategically, the Axis can Conquer Bessarabia and Vyborg quite easily from Russia for a previously unavailable 2 PUs boost. UK Pacific may activate Eastern Persia for an easy 1 PU.<br>
<br>
It is suggested to use the "ConvoyAndBlockade" tech, which is explained below, in conjuction with the "PacificIslandAndPU_Change" tech.<br>
<br>
May also be activated via <b>Map Options</b>.<br>
<br>
<b>2) "ConvoyAndBlockade"</b><br>
This adds Blockade zones to Sea Zones:64,86,91,103,107,108,116,118 and 123. In addition to interdicting Land Territory PUs, Blockade Zones also interdict Sea Zones with PU value when adjacent to said Zones.<br>
<br>
It also adds "Convoy Zones" to Sea Zones:7,77,104,117,118,123 and 124. Convoy Zones allow interdiction of Land Territory PUs. They are as follows:<br>
Sea Zone 7: Buryatia and Sakha. 2 PUs total. Russian owned.<br>
	    Sea Zone 77: Caucasus. 2 PUs total. Russian owned.<br>
	    Sea Zone 88: West Indies. 2 PUs total. American owned.<br>
	    Sea Zone 90: Southeast Mexico. 2 PUs total. American owned.<br>
	    Sea Zone 102: Central America. 2 PUs total. American owned.<br>
	    Sea Zone 104: Gold Coast and Nigeria. 2 PUS total. British owned.<br>
	    Sea Zone 117: Quebec. 2 PUs total. British owned.<br>
	    Sea Zone 118: Scotland. 2 PU total. British owned.<br>
	    Sea Zone 123: Iceland. 1 PU total. British owned.<br>
	    Sea Zone 123: New Brunswick Nova Scotia. 1 PU total. Canadian owned.<br>
	    Sea Zone 124: Nenetsia and Vologda. 2 PUs total. Russian owned.<br>
	    <br>
Sea Zones 104 and 117 are also worth 1 PU.<br>
	    Sea Zones 88,90 and 102 are worth 2 PUs.<br>
	    Sea Zones with PU value do not have their PUs transferred to an enemy, even when that enemy controls the Sea Zone. Sea Zones with PU value are not collected if enemy controlled.<br>
	    <br>
Land Territory changes are:
	    Eastern United States: 12 PUs<br>
	    Central United States: 10 PUs<br>
	    Western United States: 12 PUs<br>
	    Mexico: 1 PU<br>
	    Southeast Mexico: 2 PUs<br>
	    Central America: 2 PUs<br>
	    West Indies: 2 PUs<br>
	    <br>
	    You or your Ally must control the Convoy Zone at the "Collect PU" phase of your turn to receive the PUs from the corresponding Land Territories.<br>
	    <br>
	    Submerged Subs do not control Convoy Zones. If there is a Sub controlling a Convoy Zone and it is attacked and survives the attack by submerging, control of the Convoy Zone will revert to the Original Owner.<br>
	    <br>
	    The UK has their "British_Original"(controls all Original Territories) National Objective reduced to 3 PUs.<br>
	    <br>
	    Strategically, certain Sea Zones(91,103) may inflict substantial damage. <br>
	    <br>
	    The bottom left of the screen will show the PU value of the Sea Zone you are in. An easy way to remember is, USA Sea Zones are worth 2 PUs, UK 1 PU, except for 123 (Iceland), and USSR 0 PUs.<br>
	    <br>
	    <b>Note</b><br>Sea Zones 103, 108 and 118 are Blockade Zones. So even though they are not adjacent to a Land Territory, submerged Subs will roll for damage.<br>Also of <b>note</b> loss of Convoy Zones PUs are not indicated the way PUs lost to Blockade are at end of turn.<br>
	    They are shown in "Game History"<br>
	      <br>
	      May also be activated via <b>Map Options</b>.<br>
<br>
	    <b>6) "RussianNationalObjectives"</b><br>
	    Reduces Russia's Sea Zone 125 Lend Lease Objective to 2 PUs. Also reduces their "Spread of Communism" Objective to 2 PUs per Territory and limits those Territories to Originally German, Italian, or Pro-Axis <b>Mainland</b> European Neutral Territories.<br>
	    <br>
	    These Territories are: Bulgaria, Finland, Greater Southern Germany, Slovakia Hungary, Western Germany, Romania, Poland, Germany, Norway, Denmark, Holland Belgium, Northern Italy, Southern Italy. <br>
	    <br>
	    Adds the following NOs to Russia:
"The Northern Trace" Theme: Access to Allied Lend-Lease via the Northwest Staging Route. 2 PUs if Sea Zone 5 has no enemy warships (all sea units except Transports), Amur is Russian controlled and there are no Allied units in any Original Russian Territories.<br>
<br>
"Persian Corridor" Theme: Access to Allied Lend-Lease via the Trans-Iranian Supply Route. 2 PUs if Sea Zone 80 has no enemy warships (all sea units except Transports), Persia is Allied controlled and there are no Allied units in any Original Russian Territories.<br>
<br>
Beginning RD 3 an Additional increase of +2 PUs per Lend Lease Route goes into effect if Russia is at war and Japan declares war on Russia. Allied units <b>May</b> be present in Russia.<br>
<br>
A Russian Destroyer is added to Sea Zone 5. It must remain adjacent to Original Russian Territory while Russia is neutral to Japan.<br>
<br>
May also be activated via <b>Map Options</b>.<br>
<br>
<br>
Tech Category <b>"Redesign2"</b><br>
<br>
<b>1) "RussiaNoAllies"</b><br>
Russia receives 3 PUs if no Allied units in any Original Russian Territories.<br>
<br>
May also be activated via <b>Map Options</b>.<br>
<br>
<br>
Tech Category <b>"New Units and Unit Changes"</b><br>
<br>
<b>1)"ChineseMilitia"</b><br>
Adds the "Militia" unit for China. A0 D1 M1 C2. This helps China produce a few more units and allows them to purchase when they only have 2 PUs. Also adds a AAGun to Szechwan. Helps slow Japan down a little.<br>
<br>
<b>2) "PrimitiveTerrain"</b><br>
Places a "Primitive" image in basically all of Asia, excepting most Costal Territories, and up to the Ural Mountains in Russia. When starting in a primitive territory, M2 units have their movement reduced to 1. Does not affect aircraft.<br>
This helps slow Japan's push through China and discourages early Soviet Far East invasions.<br>
<br>
Evenkiyskiy, Urals and Kazakhstan do not receive a Primitive designation when "Chinese Guerrilla Fighters" is activated. This is to prevent Japan from being adversely affected when attacking Russia.
<br>
<br>
May also be activated via <b>Map Options</b>.<br>
<br>
<b>3) "BBandCA_AA"</b><br>
Battleships now have 1 AA shot and Cruisers 2. They hit at 1 out of 10 as opposed to 1 out of 6.<br>
<br>It is recommended to wait until RD 2 to activate BB and CA AA Guns. This prevents breaking early RD battles and reflects the early war successes in air to naval combat.<br>
<br>
If "PlanesTargetNaval" and or "PlanesTargetNavalCV" has been activated, AA shots will also fire when Attacking. They will hit at 1 out of 12 on the attack and remain 1 out of 10 on defense.<br>
<br>
May also be activated via <b>Map Options</b>.<br>
<br>
<b>4) "Mobile_Artillery"</b><br>
Adds a Mobile Artillery Unit. A2 D2 +1D w/tank, C5. Gives +1A to 1 Infantry or Mech Infantry. May blitz. Does not provide blitz ability to other units.<br>
<br>
+1D w/tank represents their use as anti-tank weapons and to prevent tank buys from being adversely affected.<br>
<br>
May also be activated via <b>Map Options</b>.<br>
<br>
<b>5) "MilitiaForAll"</b><br>
Adds the Militia Unit to all players. A Player may have no more than 8 Militia at any one time. May only be placed in originally owned Territories.<br>
<br>
This is to prevent spammage. It is also suggested to wait until Round 3 before activation. This represents full manpower mobilization and prevents an early UK stack to prevent Sea Lion. If "Chinese Militia" is not activated, China will also gain the ability to purchase Militia when "MilitiaForAll" is activated.<br>
<b>Note</b><br>UK may have up to 16 Militia. This is due to UK Pacific counting towards the total of 8. UK and UK Pacific should still follow the maximum of 8 per Player, which has to be Player Enforced  .<br>
<br>
May also be activated via <b>Map Options</b>.<br>
<br>
<b>6) "CloseAirSupport"</b><br>
Tac Bombers give +1A to Infantry and Mech Infantry on a 1:1 basis. Tac BombersC10 do not receive this ability.<br>
<br>
May also be activated via <b>Map Options</b>.<br>
<br>
<br>
Tech Category <b>"More Units and Changes"</b><br>
<br>
<b>1) "Bunkers"</b><br>
Adds the NWO Bunker unit. Bunkers are a A0 D3 M0 C5 2-hit unit. They require one of the following units for placement: Infantry, Militia, Elite, Marine and Mech Infantry. If combat damaged they also require one of the previous units to be present to repair.<br>
<br>Bunkers may be bombed by SBR's. They are destroyed when reaching 5 damage. They will function normally with 4 damage. SBR damage is repaired the same as Infrastructure damage. They will fire AA shots at SBR Bombers the same as other Infrastructure.<br>
<br>
You may place a minimum of 1 Bunker per territory. If the territory has a PU value you may place a total number of Bunkers equal to the territory value. May only place 1 Bunker per territory per turn.<br>
<br>
UK Pacific is able to place Bunkers without the required units being present. This is unintended and is player enforced.<br>
<br>
It is recommended to wait until RD 3 to activate Bunkers. This prevents breaking early RD battles and represents the time needed to build fortifications.<br>
<br>
<b>Note</b><br>Bunker 2 Hit Point and SBR Damage are separate but Image is the same. So if you repair SBR Damage or Hit Point Damage the Bunker Hit Image will show up and vice versa.<br><br>
May also be activated via <b>Map Options</b>.<br>
<br>
<b>2) "MilitaryBase_Produces_2inf</b><br>
MilitaryBases C12. May place in any territory of 1 PU or less. Maximum of 1 Base per territory. May receive up to 6 damage. Cannot place Infantry if 2 or more damage. May only palce 1 with 1 damage. Has AA capability same as Factories.<br>
<br>
<b>3) "TacticalBomberAirBattleD1"</b><br>
Gives Tactical Bombers the ability to intercept at D1. This is to help against A0C5 Bomber spam and represent Night Fighter Interceptors. <br>
<br>
<b>4) "AirfieldM2"</b><br>
Airfields now give +2 Movement to Bombers and Fighters. It is recomended to only use the additional +1 Movement for fighters when they are escorting Bombers on SBR missions. This is Player Enforced.<br>
<br>
<b>5) "PlanesTargetNaval"</b><br>
Fighters and Tactical Bombers now target Cruisers and Battleships prior to regular combat. Fighters get 1 shot that hits at 1 out of 12. Their shots do not stack.<br>
Tactical Bombers hit at 2 out of 12. Their shots do not stack.
<br>
<br>
Also Tac Bombers will Defend with "1" 1 in 12 shot against Cruisers and Battleships which will not stack and Fighters will Defend at 1 in 12, which will not stack.<br>
<br>Round 2 activation is recommended as well as using "BBandCA_AA" tech with this option.<br> 
<br>
May also be activated via <b>Map Options</b>.<br>
<br>
<b>Note</b><br>
If "SubsCanEvadeDestroyers_ChangerMustActivate" tech has been activated and Submarines are present, they will also be targeted by Tactical Bombers, along with Cruisers and Battleships.
<br>
<br>
<b>6) "PlanesTargetNavalCV"</b><br>
Fighters and Tactical Bombers now target Battleships, Cruisers and Carriers prior to regular combat. Fighters get 1 shot that hits at 1 out of 12. Their shots do not stack.<br>
Tactical Bombers hit at 2 out of 12. Their shots do not stack.
<br>
<br>
Also Tac Bombers will Defend with "1" 1 in 12 shot against Battleships, Cruisers and Carriers which will not stack and Fighters will Defend at 1 in 12, which will not stack.<br>

<b>2)Option taamvan</b><br>
Changes the control of Novgorod, Volgograd, Russia Objective to 3 PUs for Germany. Control of Caucasus is also reduced to 3.<bvr> Also adds a Fighter to Russia and a Armor to Urals.<br>
<br>
<b>3)BM Rules</b><br>
Adds the "BM Rules". Must Activate the "BM Vichy Rule" and "Chinese Guerrilla Fighters" separately. <br>
<br>
<b>4)German Boost</b><br>
Gives 1 PU to Poland, Slovakia Hungary and Greater Southern Germany. You may wish to use this option if "Victory Cities Worth 1 PU", "RussianNationalObjectives", "RussiaNoAllies" or "PacificIslandAndPU_Change" is activated if you feel Russia becomes too strong. <br>
<br>
<b>5)Philippines PU Boost</b><br>
Gives 1 PU to the Philippines. You may wish to use this option if "Victory Cities Worth 1 PU", "ChineseMilitia", "RussianNationalObjectives", "RussiaNoAllies" or "PacificIslandAndPU_Change" is activated if you feel Allies become too strong. <br>

<b>6)Towed AA Gun</b><br> Activated by <b>"AA Gun Cost 4"</b>. Is a A0 D1 M1 +1 with Mech Infantry, C5 unit. Can blitz with Mech Infantry and Armor. It has 2AA shots. May not fire more than 1 shot per plane. Can Combat Move and can conquer/capture Territories and Infrastructure.
<br>
<br>
<b>7)German Trade With Russia</b><br> When <b>Deactivated</b> Germany will not receive the Trade with Russia National objective if it has any units in Original Russian Territories.<br>
<br>
Prevents Italy declaring war on Russia and taking control of Russian Territory and having Germany move Units into that territory while not at war with Russia and still able to collect the Trade National Objective.
<br>
<br>
<b>8)Russia Spreads Communism In Africa</b><br> When <b>Deactivated</b> Russia will not receive the Spread of Communism National Objective for any Territories <b>Not</b> in <b>Mainland Europe</b>.
<br>
<br>
<b>9)China M</b><br> Adds the <b>Mursilis</b> China Rules. Changes China's National Objective to 1 PU for each Burma Road Territory that is Allied controlled. Also allows Artillery builds as long as at least <b>1</b> of Burma or India is under Allied control.<br>
<br>
If <b>Chinese Guerrilla Fighters</b> have been activated, they will now only spawn once <b>All</b> Burma Road Territories are under Axis control.<br>
<br>
<b>Note</b><br>
UK Pacific is Allied with China from the start, which allows UK Pacific Units to move into China. This is unintended and will need to be Player Enforced. May be fixed in the future.
<br>
<br>
<b>10)China M BM</b><br>When used with the "China M" option, Chinese Guerrillas will spawn according to BM Rules .
<br>
<br>
<b>11)Italy Controls Original</b><br> Italy receives 3 PUs when it controls all of it's Original Territories.
<br>
<br>
<b>12)USA bonus for North Africa 3 PU</b><br> Reduces the BM North Africa USA bonus to 3.<br>
<br>
<b>Note</b><br>
You need to turn off the "USA bonus for North Africa" option or it will show up as well.
<br>
<br>
<b>13)Western Europe Beach Head 3 PU</b><br> Reduces the BM Western Europe Beach Head for USA bonus to 3.<br>
<br>
<b>Note</b><br>
You need to turn off the "Western Europe Beach Head" option or it will show up as well.
<br>
<br>
<b>14)Supply Token</b><br> Adds the <b>Argothair</b> Supply Token. A <b> Big Thank You</b> to redrum and Hepps. They made it <b>MUCH</b> easier to implement. When activated you will be able to buy the "Supply Crate" Unit. It is a A0 D0 M1 C5 Unit. It may be Bombed. 7 damage will kill it. If "A0C5 Bomber" has been activated, then 5 damage will kill it. It is unaffected with less damage. It will fire AA same as Minor Factories. If captured they will immediately turn into "3 PUs". There is no limit on how many may be captured per turn. It has the same transport value as Infantry. Not meant for Air Transport.<br>
<br>
Will change to Allied control in certain Territories. Also certain Territories will convert Crates up to their Territory value to "5 PUs" each if a Factory is present. So Russia could convert 3 "Crates" for 15 PUs. The Territories are as follows:<br>
<br>
<b>Germany</b><br>
W Germany, Germany, and Romania will convert Allied Crates to German ones and turn them into PUs.You will need a Factory in Romania. <br><br>
<b>Russia</b><br>
Archangel, Russia, Volgograd, Caucasus and Amur will convert Allied Crates to Russian. Russia, Volgograd, Novograd and Caucasus will turn them into PUs. Caucasus will need a factory to do so.<br>
<br> 
There is a separate "Map Option" for Amur. It doesn’t need a Factory to convert Crates. It works the same as the Factories and only coverts as many as its TTy value. In this case 1. It also places a DD and Trprt in SZ 5. They may only move in SZs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9 and 10 until at war with Japan. Movement restrictions are then lifted.<br>
<br>
<b>Japan</b><br>
India and West India will convert Crates and turn them into PUs. W India would need a factory. <br>
<br>
<b>USA</b><br>
Eastern US and Western US will only convert up to 4 Crates each per turn instead of their Territory value. Also Canada Crates will not convert. This was to keep Canada from just buying Crates and sending them to the US and doing nothing else. <br>
<br>
<b>China</b><br>
They do not participate. An option for them may be added in the future.<br>
<br>
<b>UK</b><br>
They and UKP work a little different than everybody else due to the way triplea does the split income thingy. UK and Scotland convert Crates up to their TTy value and turn them into dough. Scotland needs a Factory for that. They convert Crates to UK Crates up to TTy value per Allied turn regardless of how many UK Crates are there. So if USA sends 12 Crates to UK, 6 would convert to Uk Crates and the other 6 would stay US. Then, hypothetically, Canada could land 8 Crates and UK would convert 6 to UK crates as well. The other 2 staying Canadian.<br>
<br>
<b>UKP</b><br>
India and West India convert Crates the same way as UK does. W India needs a Factory. When converting to PUs, they use a National Objective. Instead of saying “Units Generate … PUs”, it will instead say they reached a "National Objective". This does not show up in the Objectives tab.<br>
<br>
<b>Italy</b><br>
N Italy and S Italy convert Crates and turn them into PUs.<br>
<br>
<b>Canada</b><br>
Quebec converts Crates and turns them into PUs. It won’t convert UK Crates. This may be changed in the future.<br>
<br>
<b>ANZAC</b><br>
Queensland, New South Wales and New Zealand convert Crates. Queensland and NSWs will convert them to PUs. NSWs would need a Factory. If “Factory Limited” is activated, New Zealand will also convert them to PUs.<br>
<br>
<b>France</b><br>
Normandy, S France and France itself, all convert Crates. They all convert them to PUs.<br>

<b>17)BB and CA 2 Shot</b><br>
Recommended for use with "Option Redesign" and "Convoy and Blockade".<br>
Battleships now have 2 shots at 4 when attacking and 2 shots at <b>3</b> when defending. Cruisers have 2 shots at <b>2</b> when attacking and defending. BB Bombard at 2 shots at 2 and CAs 2 shots at 1.<br>
When damaged a Battleship will only have 1 shot at 4 and 1 at 2 while Bombarding.<br><br>
<b>Note</b><br>You must turn off "LHTR Heavy bombers" in map options, or it will still roll twice but only use the best one. <br><br>
Also while a Submarine's First Strike will damage a BB, the BB will still fire 2 shots for the first round of combat. The secound round it will only fire once or be immediately sunk if hit by another First Strike.<br><br>
If you edit a damaged battleship you will also need to add 1 hit of damage or it will not repair correctly.<br><br>
To keep from breaking round 1 battles, Germany has C5 Destroyers placed in 125 Sea Zone, 112 Sea Zone and 113 Sea Zone. 113 also receives a Submarine.<br>The UK receives a Submarine in 99 Sea Zone and Japan a C5 Destroyer in 19 Sea Zone.<br><br>
This is to help counter the "Cost 5 Destroyer" from being too powerful. You will also want to use "Carrier Cost 13" and"Escort Carrier Cost 7". This will help some, but Carriers will still be weaker compared to Out Of Box.<br><br>
<b>18)"Charles de Gaulle Neutrals Modified"</b><br>
Adds "Charles de Gaulle Neutrals" (Only "Modified" option is available).<br>Discussed in detail here:<b>https://www.axisandallies.org/forums/topic/28180/should-we-make-better-rules-for-invadable-neutrals-1940/4?page=1</b><br><br>
Check the box in "Map Options" before game start. You will need to declare war against the True Neutrals in order to attack them. You will need to <b>Player Enforce</b> correct "Neutral" behavior if needed. <br><br> 
Neutral Ships don’t affect naval at all unless you are attacking them. Neutral Navies are represented with a "Neutral_Navy" <img src="Neutral_Navy.png"/> unit placed in their Home country. You will need to <b>Edit</b> the appropriate number of Ships <b>Before</b> your Combat Move.<br><br>
When attacking a neutral, the units written here are immediately placed in the attacked territory as well as any territories alligned to them (triplea does this automatically). The opposing team will pick a player<b> Player Enforced</b> to represent those forces and collect income from any of their territories you failed to take. So, after combat, use edit to change any surviving units and the territory itself, to the Player of your choice.<br>
<br>
The neutrals which have more than one territory are:<br>
Mongolia (use OOB rules for this one)<br>
Portugal: Portugal, Portuguese Giunea, Angola, Mozambique<br>
Spain: Spain, Rio de Oro<br>
<br>
<b>NOTE</b><br>
If Russia attacks Amur or Korea and the Japanese then Declare War on Mongolia, the Mongolian Infantry will immediately turn Russian <b>BUT</b> the Territories will become Pro Allied. <br>
<br>
The new neutral setup is:<br>
<br>
Venezuela: 6 infantry<br>
Colombia: 1 infantry<br>
Ecuador: 1 infantry<br>
Peru: 1 infantry<br>
Bolivia: 1 infantry<br>
Paraguay: 1 infantry<br>
Uraguay: 1 infantry<br>
Argentina: 6 infantry<br>
SZ 66 (alligned with Argentina): 1 cruiser<br>
Chile: 4 infantry<br>
Mozambique: 1 infantry<br>
Angola: 1 infantry<br>
Portugal: 4 infantry, 1 artillery, 1 AA gun<br>
SZ 104 (alligned with Portugal): 1 cruiser, 1 transport<br>
Spain: 10 infantry, 1 artillery, 1 AA gun, 1 tank, 1 fighter<br>
SZ 92 (alligned with Spain): 1 destroyer<br>
SZ 91 (alligned with Spain): 1 destroyer<br>
Switzerland: 6 infantry<br>
Sweden: 6 infantry, 1 artillery, 1 AA gun<br>
SZ 114 (alligned with Sweden): 1 destroyer<br>
Turkey: 8 infantry, 1 artillery, 1 AA gun, 1 fighter<br>
SZ 99 (alligned with Turkey): 1 destroyer<br>
Arabia: 6 infantry<br>
Afghanistan: 4 infantry<br><br>

<b>"Charles de Gaulle Neutrals Modified"</b>.<br>
Changes the unit setup for:<br>
Poland: -2 infantry adds 1 fighter<br>
Switzerland: -2 infantry adds 1 artillery, 1 AA gun<br>
Venezuela: -1 infantry adds 1 artillery<br>
Argentina: -1 infantry adds 1 artillery<br>
Chile: -1 infantry adds 1 artillery<br>

<br>Discussed in detail here:<b>https://www.axisandallies.org/forums/topic/28180/should-we-make-better-rules-for-invadable-neutrals-1940/4?page=1</b><br><br>
<b>19)Long Range Fighter</b><br>
A3 D4 M5 +1 w/Airfield C12. May not land on or be transported by Carriers. May be purchased beginning of round 3.<br>
This provides Escort primarily for A0 C5 Strategic Bombers. Air battle is same as regular Fighter.<br><br>
<b>Does Not Work with Technology</b><br>
<br>
<b>20)Destroyer Cost 6</b><br>
This is only usable with "SubsCanEvadeDestroyers_ChangerMustActivate" or "Option Redesign". It increases the cost of "DestroyerC5" to 6 PUs.<br>
DDC5 was overpowered compared to OOB. DDC6 is close to OOB except for being slightly weaker compared to Battleship and Carrier with Tac and Ftr. As the Defensive Fleet has the advantage, this should help reduce naval stalemates.<br><br>
<b>21)Battleship Cost 18</b><br>
Reduces the cost of Battleship to 18 PUs. This is to help encourage Battleship builds.<br><br>
<b>22)Carrier Cost 13</b><br>
Reduces the cost of Carrier to 13 PUs. This is for use if "BB and CA 2 Shot" is activated.<br><br>
<b>23)Escort Carrier Cost 7</b><br>
Reduces the cost of Escort Carrier to 7 PUs. This is for use if "Carrier Cost 13" is activated.<br><br>
<b>24)Cruiser Cost 11</b><br>
Reduces the cost of Cruiser to 11 PUs. This is to help encourage Cruiser builds.<br><br>
<b>25)Italy Boost</b><br>
Gives +1 PU to Northern and Southern Italy.<br><br>
<b>26)Mongolia Boost</b><br>
Gives 1 PU to Dzavhan and Ulaanbaatar. Adds some incentive for Japan to attack Russia when "Primitive Terrain" is activated. Gives Russia a little mini boost at the same time.<br><br>
<b>27)"Germany 5 PU Controls France RD 10"</b><br>
Germany receives 5 PUs when it controls France round 10 and later.<br><br>
<b>28)"Normandy Original Owner Pro Neutral Allies"</b><br>
When France is Liberated, Normandy Bordeaux will no longer turn French.<br><br>
<b>29)"China AA Gun"</b><br>
Adds an AA Gun to Szechwan.<br><br>
<b>30)"Japan Attacks Russia"</b><br>
Unless Russia attacks Japan first, not just a DOW, <b>ANY</b> Japanese attack activates Mongolia.<br><br>
Most of these house rules are discussed in this thread: www.axisandallies.org/forums/index.php?topic=36518.0 started by Black_Elk. They are also discussed here: www.axisandallies.org/forums/index.php?topic=34568.30<br>
<br>
<b>31)"Vichy Rule French Battleship Sea Zone 92"</b><br>
A French Battleship is added to Sea Zone 92 at game setup. To be used when Vichy Rules are active. Explained after the BM Rules below.<br>
<br>
<b>32)"Battleships and Carriers 2 Round Purchase"</b><br>
Capital ships require an existing Hull from a previous round in order to build the finished sea unit. Carriers can be built from either a Carrier Hull or a Battleship Hull (albeit more expensive by being built from Battleship Hulls), but Battleships can only be built from Battleship Hulls.<br><br>
During the purchase phase of the round that you want to place a Carrier or Battleship you must also have a Drydock in your purchases. Only one Drydock needs to be purchased per game as it stays within your purchases and cannot be consumed. The Drydock is required specifically for the game engine to launch Battleships.<br><br>
The Hull(s) that you intend to convert to finished unit(s) need to be moved to the chosen sea zone during non combat. If this step is missed then one needs to edit in the complete unit(s), remove the hull(s), take note of purchases remaining, and perhaps reduce PUs by the purchases remaining that could not be placed properly.<br>
<br>
Game setup adds Hulls to the following territories to accommodate existing game starting strategies as well as following historical circumstances.<br>
<br>
Western Germany: 1 Carrier Hull<br>
Japan: 1 Battleship Hull<br>
Eastern United States: 1 Carrier Hull, 1 Battleship Hull<br>
<br>
It is recommended to use the "Escort Carrier" Map Option when using "Battleships and Carriers 2 Round Purchase". This allows for 1 turn Carrier builds.<br>
<br>
<b>33)Escort Carriers 1 Movement"</b><br>
This option modifies the Escort Carrier's movement to only being 1 (+1 w/ NB). Playing with Escort Carriers needs to be turned on via its Map Option.<br>

<b>**REVISIONS**</b><br><br>

<hr><br>

<b>Revised Air Raid Rules:</b> Fighters attack and defend at 2. Strategic and tactical bombers attack at 1.<br><br>

<b>Revised Capital Capture Rules:</b> The capture of a player's capital results in the plunder of that player's PUs only the <b>first</b> time the capital is taken. Subsequent recapture of the same capital results in the player's PUs being destroyed.<br><br>

<b>Revised Victory Conditions:</b> If Germany is Allied controlled, an Axis victory in the Pacific requires 7 (rather than 6) Pacific VCs. If Japan is Allied controlled, an Axis victory in Europe requires 9 (rather than 8) Europe VCs. 

<br><br>


<b>New Unit - Marines:</b> Cost 5; Attack at 1 (2 during amphibious assaults); Defend at 2; No bonus from artillery; Can be loaded onto cruisers and battleships (1 to a ship). <br><br>
<b>Note:</b> During amphibious assaults, Battleships and Cruisers may bombard any adjacent territory in which an amphibious assault is occurring, regardless of where they unloaded their marines.

<br><br>

<b>**VICHY FRANCE RULE SET**</b>
<br><br>
The following rule-set simulates the circumstances and strategic consequences of the Franco-German Armistice, and is intended for play with the G40 Balance Mod.
<br><br>
<b>Game Conditions for Franco-German Armistice</b> 
<br><br>
At the beginning of France's turn, if the following conditions are met, the Franco-German Armistice will occur:
<br><br>
1. Axis has control of both France and Normandy Bordeaux;<br>
2. Axis has never controlled Southern France; and<br>
3. There are no non-French, Allied land units in Southern France.<br>
<br><br>
<b>Game Consequences of Franco-German Armistice</b>
<br><br>
<b>French Territorial Control:</b> At the beginning of France's first turn in which Armistice conditions are met, all originally French territories not already under Axis control immediately change ownership to Pro-Axis Neutrals, except: (1) French Equatorial Africa; (2) New Hebrides; (2) any French territories containing non-French allied land units.
<br><br>
Any non-French allied air units in Vichy-controlled territory are destroyed upon conversion of the territory to Vichy control.
<br><br>
With the exception of Southern France (see discussion of "Zone Libere" below), Vichy French territory operates the same way as other Pro-Axis Neutral territory. An Axis player may capture Vichy French territory and commandeer its forces by moving a land unit into the territory during the non-combat phase of his turn.
<br><br>
Fly-over restrictions applicable to other Neutral territories do not apply to Vichy French territory.
<br><br>
<b>Fleet at Toulon:</b> In addition to the change in French territorial control, the Armistice changes control of the the French fleet in sz 93, from French to Pro-Axis neutral. The Vichy French fleet maintains a strictly defensive posture. It may not be moved. It may not be captured by the Axis. The fleet is immediately destroyed if any power, other than the Free French, occupies Southern France 
<br><br>
<b>"Zone Libre":</b> Any Axis occupation of Southern France following the Armistice results in the scuttling of the Vichy French Fleet at Toulon and the disbandment of all remaining Vichy French forces. These forces are removed at the end of the Axis player's turn in which the occupation of Southern France takes place. Any formerly Vichy French forces that were previously commandeered by the Axis are unaffected by this change.
<br><br>
<b>Armistice's Effect on National Objectives:</b> Following the armistice, Southern France is considered Axis-controlled for purposes of Italy's "Roman Empire" objective. Otherwise, the Vichy France arrangement has no impact on National Objectives. Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco must still be directly occupied by Germany or Italy to achieve Italy's "North Africa" objective. Japanese occupation of French Indo China still negates Japan's "Trade With America" objective. 
<br><br>
<b>Liberation of France:</b> The Allied liberation of France effectively terminates the Armistice. Any territory and forces still under Vichy French control (including any surviving fleet in sz 93) revert back to Free French control. The Vichy French forces in the Southern France and sz 93 will also revert back if Southern France is liberated by the Free French. 

<br><br>
<b>**FRENCH BATTLESHIP IN SEA ZONE 92 OPTION**</b>
<br><br>
The following rule-set adds to the circumstances and strategic consequences surrounding the Franco-German Armistice by simulating various scenarios based on the French fleet at Mers-el-Kebir.  It is intended for play with the Vichy rule-set active to add an element of balance and trade offs for both sides with historical and realistic consequences depending on the actions taken.
<br><br>
If the Vichy conditions are not attained by France's first turn then the battleship can be moved freely as a French unit.  
<br><br>
<b>Game Conditions for French Battleship Scenarios</b> 
<br><br>
At the beginning of France's turn, the following conditions create scenario paths if met and are in addition to the Franco-German Armistice taking place:
<br><br>
1. Axis have eliminated the French battleship; or<br>
2. Allied ship(s) share Sea Zone 92 with the French battleship; or<br>
3. The French battleship resides alone in Sea Zone 92.
<br><br>
<b>Game Consequences for Respective French Battleship Scenarios</b>
<br><br>
1. The Vichy rule-set will have no additional changes; or<br>
2. The historical attack by the British on Mers-el-Kebir is assumed to have taken place. The surviving French fleet will move to Sea Zone 87 off of the port of Dakar in French West Africa and act defensively as a Pro-Axis neutral battleship; or<br>
3. The French battleship will convert to a Pro-Axis neutral battleship and continue to reside in Sea Zone 92 with normal game mechanics.
<br><br>
<b>Further Game Conditions for Scenario Paths 2 & 3</b> 
<br><br>
Immediately upon these conditions being met new paths will take place:
<br><br>
2/3a. Allies have eliminated the Pro-Axis neutral battleship; or<br>
2/3b. Axis have occupied Southern France while the Pro-Axis neutral battleship still remains on the board; or<br>
3c. Axis have occupied Algeria while the Pro-Axis neutral battleship still remains on the board.
<br><br>
<b>Further Game Consequences for Respective Scenario Paths 2 & 3</b>
<br><br>
2/3a. The Vichy rule-set will have no additional changes and the battleship and its triggers are completely removed from the game; or<br>
2/3b. The battleship will convert to a Pro-Allies neutral battleship and locate to Sea Zone 87. French West Africa and the infantry unit will also convert to being Pro-Allies neutral if still Pro-Axis: or<br>
3c. Same result as 2/3b but only works for path 3.
<br><br>
<b>Additional Game Conditions for French North Africa</b> 
<br><br>
Checked at the beginning of France's turn while the battleship still remains in play:
<br><br>
i. The battleship is Pro-Allies in Sea Zone 87 or Pro-Axis in Sea Zone 92;<br>
ii. French West Africa is not yet owned by a power at war; and<br>
iii. The Allies control both Morocco and Algeria.
<br><br>
<b>Additional Game Consequences for French North Africa</b>
<br><br>
i. The battleship will convert to a Free French battleship and locate to Sea Zone 87;<br>
ii. The infantry unit in French West Africa will convert to a Free French marine;<br>
iii. French West Africa will convert to Pro-Allies if it was not already; and<br>
vi. These units will not be able to move this turn and will act defensively until commands are given on France's next turn.

  <b>Global 1940 Second Edition</b><br>
<br>
<b>Credits:</b> Bung, Veqryn<br><br>
<br>
<b>Note</b><br>
This game uses the latest Global 1940 2nd Edition (successor to Alpha +3) rules, as posted on Larry's website.<br>
To blitz move mech_infantry with armour, you must click on them both at the same time (use CTRL to create waypoints).<br>
Paratroopers tech enables a second combat movement phase which happens right after the first combat movement phase, and the second one only allowes movement of paratrooping infantry.<br>
<br>

<b>Disclaimer</b><br>
The game is not meant to take over your responsibility in knowing the rules. For example, the game engine is not always going to restrict or allow certain attacks. 
It is your responsibility to know the rules and abide by them. Most of the game notes that follow can be thought of as differences compared to WWIIv3 or WWIIv4 rules but obviously are not a complete manual for the game. 
Beginners to these games are suggested to ask for help in the lobby or on the forums at http://www.tripleawarclub.org<br>
You must always validate your own movement, especially air movement at sea.  The engine is not perfect.<br>
<br>

<b>Edit Mode</b><br>
If you ever need to create new UK units, always create "British" units, do not create "UK_Pacific" units (except for Factories, all UK_Pacific units turn into British units when placed normally).<br>
The Warbonds technology will give the PUs to the British, please use edit mode if you want some of it to go to UK Pacific.<br>
You may also need to use edit mode to correct things listed below.<br>
<br>

<br>Below is a list of rules that the TripleA game engine either does not enforce, or enforces incorrectly, at this point.
<br>Each item starts with a code in parentheses that represents how you may fix or correct the rule.
<br>(PE) = Player Enforced = You must be aware of the rule and must follow it. The engine will not stop you from breaking the rule.
<br>(CL) = Comment Log = You must record what you are doing in the comment log, because TripleA does not keep that information around. (To access the comment log, go to the 'view' menu, and click 'show comment log', then type a comment there.)
<br>(SR) = Save/Reload = You may save the game now or at the start of the phase, then reload it, in order to solve this problem.
<br>(EM) = Edit Mode = You must use Edit Mode to correct or fix the error, because the engine either disallows the rule or otherwise does something wrong that you can correct.
<br>(NA) = None Available = There is no fix available for this yet.
<br>
<br><b>Rules specific to 1940 the engine does not do, but you must follow:</b>
<br>* (EM) You may ask for permission during your turn to move through a canal owned by a power you are not yet at war with (use edit mode to move them).
<br>* (CL) TripleA does not keep track of which neutral territories have been previously attacked (use comment log to keep track of this instead).
<br>* (PE) You are not allowed to blitz or move any units through Friendly Neutrals, including the same turn they are captured, unless they have been previously attacked.
<br>* (PE) You may not land air units in Friendly Neutrals, including the same turn they are captured, unless they have been previously attacked.
<br>* (PE) You can not fly over unfriendly neutrals, unless they are being attacked or they have previously been attacked.
<br>* (PE) Friendly Neutrals can not be 'captured' with an AA Gun, only by land units with an attack power.
<br>* (PE) You may not build facilities on territories that were Dutch at the start of your turn.
<br>* (PE) You may not attack a territory containing units owned by a nation that you are not at war with (even if the territory is owned by someone you are at war with).
<br>* (PE) USA may not end movement in seazone adjacent to Japanese controlled territories when not at war with Japan (Sea Zones 6, 17, 19, 20, 22, 32, 33, 34, 36, and 37).
<br>* (EM) Japan can fly over UK and French territories before going to war with them.
<br>* (EM) USA does not have to declare war at the end of USA 3 if they do not want to.
<br>* (PE) You may not conduct an amphibious assault from an allied transport if the defender could scramble and you have no other combat units to protect that transport.
<br>* (EM) If Russia is at war with Italy, but not with Germany, a German warship in sz125 will cancel Russia's national objective (and same if at war with Germany but not Italy, and there is an Italian boat in sz125).
<br>* (EM) If UK Pacific captures Japan, the money should go to UK Pacific, even if UK Pacific's capital is occupied.
<br>* (EM) You must place all units you purchased if you are able to, or as many as you can. Any units not placed get refunded to you (TripleA instead carries them over to the next turn).
<br>* (PE) The victory conditions must be held for a full continuous round after they are achieved (so for example if Italy takes Egypt as the 8th European VC, then the Axis must hold 8 VCs continuously until Italy's next turn).
<br>* (NA) During an SBR, AA fire and casualty selection should be done on a per-facility-being-attacked basis.
<br>* (EM) Rocket damage to an airfield should occur after scrambling, which means if an airbase is disabled by the rocket attack, it could still scramble this turn.
<br>* (PE) Paratroopers (airborne) may not attack multiple territories from a single airbase.
<br>
<br><b>General rules for all A&A games that the engine does not do, but you must follow:</b>
<br>* (PE) Battles should be resolved in this order: all SBR, then all Amphibious Assaults, then all others.
<br>* (SR or EM) Repairing and Purchase are should actually be done at the same time.
<br>* (CL) TripleA does keep track of which units are on which transports, but there is no easy way to see this information when it is not your turn.
<br>* (CL) TripleA should, but does not keep track of which air units are on which carriers.
<br>* (PE) All air moved must have a way of potentially being picked up or landing, and all air that survives combat MUST be picked up if possible.
<br>* (PE) TripleA should not allow non-combat moves to be done during combat move phase.
<br>* (PE) Only non-air units that did not move during combat move and did not participate in combat, may move during non-combat-move.
<br>* (PE) Transports can only be loaded in 1 phase (not both), and unloaded in 1 phase (not both).
<br>* (PE) Transports if unloading for amphibious assault, must unload all their units, and may not hold back some units while offloading other units.
<br>* (NA) Rocket attacks should all be chosen first, before any dice and results are shown.
<br>* (NA) You should be able to SBR / Rocket attack an empty territory that you are blitzing.
<br>* (NA) Each phase of combat should have all units in that phase fire before any casualty selection occurs, whereas right now in TripleA if air and subs are involved then units might be broken up into smaller groups and casualty selection done for each group.
<br>* (EM) If you select for a bombardment from a sea zone, you should be able to select which units you want to have bombard, but currently all possible units are used.
<br>

<b>Political Situation</b><br>
At the start of the game Germany and Italy are at war with the UK and ANZAC and France only, while Japan is at war with China only. Any countries not at war with each other ignore each other's naval units and obviously cannot go into each others ground territories. There are a number of specific politically related rules/conditions for each country:<br><br>

<b>Germany/Italy/Japan</b>
<ul>
<li>Germany/Italy/Japan can declare war on USA or Russia or China at any time.</li>
<li>If Germany/Italy/Japan is at war with one of USA or Russia or China it doesn't affect relations with the other.</li>
<li>While not yet at war with the USA, Japan may not move into sea zones within 2 spaces of Western USA or Alaska.</li>
</ul>
<br><b>Russia</b>
<ul>
<li>Russia cannot go to war against the Germans and Italians until the <b>beginning of purchase units phase</b> of Russia 4, unless of course they attack it first, or the Axis capture London.</li>
<li>Russia and Japan may declare war on each other at any time.  When not at war, Russia may not enter China.</li>
</ul>
<br><b>USA</b>
<ul>
<li>If USA is not at war with Germany or Italy, USA may only move its units to sea zones touching USA territories and also Sea Zone 102.</li>
<li>If USA is not at war with Japan, USA may not move its units into sea zones touching Japanese controlled territories.</li>
<li>USA cannot go to war against the Axis until the <b>beginning of PU collect phase</b> of USA 3, unless of course an Axis power attacks it first.</li>
<li>Once at war, the Minor Factories in continental USA upgrade to Major Factories automatically for free, and may be used immediately.</li>
</ul>
<br><b>Neutrals</b><br>
There are three types of neutrals: 
<ul>
<li>pro-Axis: When an Axis unit moves into one of these zones for the first time, that country gets a one-time bonus number of infantry, specified on the map, and control of the territory. The new infantry cannot be moved until the next turn.</li>
<li>pro-Allies: When an Allied unit moves into one of these zones for the first time, that country gets a one-time bonus number of infantry, specified on the map, and control of the territory. The new infantry cannot be moved until the next turn.</li>
<li>Regular: If a power attacks a regular neutral, all the other regular neutrals on the board become friendly to the other team.</li>
</ul>

<b>Note:</b> Capture of friendly neutrals must be done during Non Combat Movement.<br><br>

When a country moves into a regular or non-friendly neutral during the combat move, it must conduct combat with the number of infantry specified on the map for that neutral. If it loses or retreats, however many infantry that remain are how many that stay in the zone. This means that if Finland was +4 for Axis, and Russia kills 2 infantry and retreats, then Axis only get 2 infantry when they move into Finland.

</ul>
<br><hr><br>


<br><br><hr><br>
<b>Kamikaze Attacks</b><br>
Japan starts the game with 6 attack tokens, and may begin doing Kamikaze Attacks at the start of the game.<br>
These attacks can only be done in sea zones that contain the Kamikaze symbol [the sea zones surrounding: Japan, Okinawa, Iwo Jima, Formosa, and the Marianas].<br>
At the end of Japan's enemy's combat-move phase, Japan may target any surface warship in a Kamikaze zone for one or more Kamikaze attacks, ONLY if the enemy is attacking Japanese units there or is conducting an Amphibious Assault from that sea zone.<br>
For each attack, a die is rolled, and a 2 or less is considered a hit. Casualties are removed immediately, and do not participate in any battles. Kamikaze attacks prevent bombardment as well.<br>
<br><br><hr><br>

<b>Submarines Prevent Unescorted Transports From Making Amphibious Assaults</b><br>
In any Sea Zone containing an enemy submarine, but not containing an owned warship, the submarine will prevent the offloading of troops for an amphibious assault. 
<br><br><hr><br>


<b>Scrambling</b><br>
Fighters and/or Tactical bombers can be scrambled from any territory bordering a sea zone, with an operating airfield (less than 3 damage) to help defend the surrounding sea zone using their standard defense values. They cannot retreat from scrambling (defenders can never retreat) and if the territory they were scrambled from is captured, they're given one extra movement point to land on a friendly territory or open carrier. Scrambled air cannot participate in any other battles that round.
<br><br><hr><br>

<b>Strategic Bombing Runs (SBR)</b><br>
Bombing can now happen against both types of ICs, harbours, and airfields (attackers choice)[tactical bombers can not target factories though]. Fighters can participate in the bombing run as escorts. Fighters in the territory being bombed can be launched as interceptors (no airfield necessary).<br><br>
<b>If interceptors are launched:</b> a one-round air battle takes place right away all air involved roll at 1 (jets rolls at 2). Either attacking bombers or fighters can be taken as casualties.<br><br>
After the air battle, or if there were no interceptors, the escorts are retreated and any bombers/tacs remaining can now be divied up to attack specific targets. Each target rolls its built-in AA gun against the bombers/tacs targetting it. If there is an AA gun in the territory being bombed it does <b>not</b> roll because its there to defend combat units and not complexes/bases.
<br><br>

<br><br><hr><br>

<b>Blockade Zones</b><br>
If any enemy ships are in a power's blockade zones at the end of that power's turn, and the power controls the adjacent ground territory, then the power may lose some of the PUs it would have otherwise collected.<br>
Surface warships roll 1 dice, Submarines and Air units roll 2 dice, and carriers and transports roll zero dice.  For any roll of 3 or less, that amount of PUs will not be collected by the surrounding land territories.
The power in question cannot lose more PUs from a blockade zones then the worth of the adjacent ground territory to those zones.

<br><br><hr><br>

<b>Placement Restrictions</b>
<ul>
<li>Major Industrial Complexes can only go in territories worth 3 or more, and must be originally owned territories.</li>
<li>Minor Industrial Complexes can only go in territories worth 2 or more.</li>
<li>Industrial Complexes can't be built on islands.</li>
<li>Over-purchase is returned and money is reimbursed.</li>
<li>Aircraft can be placed on the ground or on a [new] carrier in the adjacent sea zone that has a spot(s) open.</li>
</ul>
<br><hr><br>

<b>Units</b><br>
These changes to units are things other than price/movement which you can see in the buy menu.
<ul>
<li>Bombers now do 2 additional damage in strategic bombing raids, in addition to their dice roll.</li>
<li>Carriers are two hit.</li>
<li>Minor Industrial Complexes have 3 production capacity. A Minor IC can be upgraded to a Major IC for 20 PUs, but only on originally owned territories.</li>
<li>Major Industrial Complexes have 10 production capacity. When a Major IC is captured it automatically becomes a minor IC.</li>
<li>AA Guns may be taken casualty in combat, and may only fire at up to 3 aircraft each.</li>
</ul>

<b>New Units</b><br>
<b>Tactical Bombers:</b> can land on carriers, can bomb, and if paired with <b>a tank or fighter</b> the Tac attacks at 4. Tactical Bombers can also strategic bomb Airfields and Harbours (but not factories).<br>
<b>Mechanized Infantry:</b> can blitz when paired with a tank, and are supportable by artillery.<br>
<b>Carriers:</b> now have 2 hitpoints, and when damaged they do not allow fighters to land, or to leave if cargo.<br>
<br>
<b>New Buildings</b><br>
<b>Harbour:</b> Any ships that start their turn in a sea zone adjacent to a harbour get +1 movement points. Any damaged ships are repaired by a harbour at the start of the player's purchase and repair turn phase. Lastly, harbours can be bombed, and if they have 3 or more damage then they do not provide the above bonuses.<br>
<b>Airfield:</b> Any air that start their turn on the ground territory with an airfield get +1 movement points. Airfields allow up to 3 planes on that island to scramble (see Scramble section above). Airfields can be bombed, and if they have 3 or more damage then they do not provide the movement bonus.
